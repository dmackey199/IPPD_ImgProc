## About edge.py
edge.py is a sample module from the OpenCV samples folder.  
It requires modules video.py, common.py, and tst_scene_render.py to execute. The file activates the camera and begins using the Canny Edge detection algorithm to trace the edges of camera feed. It has adjustable threshold bars that affect how sensitive the algorithm is. To use the file, simply do:
```
python edge.py
```
and play with the threshold scales to see how it affects the highlighted edges it detects.
